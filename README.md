## CS441 Interesting API

For this assignment I created an app where you would enter text and
the text-to-speech would be visualized. The seekbars and the drop down
menu allow the user to adjust the pitch, sound, and even the voice of
the audio. For the voice, even though there are various languages
listed it does not translate the text (except for numbers); it instead
just says that text that is written and so the audio may have have an
accent depending on the voice chosen.
